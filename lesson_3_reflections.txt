When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I'd like to use a remote repository when i'm collaborating with a group on a project. In that way, it is easy to push and pull
into and from the remote repo. If I keep all my work local, that probably means its private and if its a group project, even
though you might make git commits but your group members will not see your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
It's best to pull manually rather than to have Git do stay up-to-date, that gives you the liberty
to choose when you want to pull from the remote repository.
