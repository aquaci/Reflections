When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I'd like to use a remote repository when i'm collaborating with a group on a project. In that way, it is easy to push and pull
into and from the remote repo. If I keep all my work local, that probably means its private and if its a group project, even
though you might make git commits but your group members will not see your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
It's best to pull manually rather than to have Git do stay up-to-date, that gives you the liberty
to choose when you want to pull from the remote repository.

Describe the difference between forks, clone, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking is almost similar to cloning but the difference is that cloning downloads the repository to your computer whilst forking replicates the repository to your virtual Github account. Branches are used when you want to test the master branch but you dont want to mess it up. Branching from the master, you can test it on all the feauture you want without hurting the master branch. In case the test is successful, you can merge it with the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git and Github, collaborating would be time consuming, i think. Because we will have to create a file and shared them on cloud storage app or compressed the file and send them through email so that our partner would have access to the files we are working on. The only thing that would be easy is that we wont have to memorise all the git commands :).

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
